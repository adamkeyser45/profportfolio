      <p>
        My professional journey to coding began differently than most programmers. It started when I graduated college with a degree in Elementary Education. 
        My first teaching position as a 4th grade ELA and Social Studies teacher was at Hazelwood Elementary in Clarksville, Tennessee. After working there for two years, 
        I found a similar job in Nashville, TN. It was my two years at Inglewood Elementary where I really took interest in coding.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inglewood is a STEAM Magnet School. Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math were to be incorporated in every aspect of the school. Even the playground 
        equipment outside could be programmed with a basic coding language, Scratch, to make sounds and noises when interacted with by students. I began to see what 
        amazing things could be done when you can incorporate education and programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a web developer, it is my goal to help create websites, programs, and tools that can be used inside a classroom to support teachers in teaching, and students in learning.
