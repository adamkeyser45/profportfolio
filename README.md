# Adam Keyser's Professional Portfolio

## Description: 
My personal (working) professional portfolio that demonstrates my coding and programming skills.

## Process:
First, I looked at example websites, such as the Run-Buddy website we are building through the online modules, for inspiration. Using those as a template, I sketched out a rough idea for what I wanted my webpage to look like. I wanted to be able to show off my background in education to future employers, which I think will set me apart from other applicants. After sketching out my idea, I began coding a simple outline of the page in HTML. When the basic structure was sound, I then moved on to add CSS style to each section. Finally, I ended by adapting the webpage to be able to be mobile-friendly.

## Challenges:
I feel that my largest challenges came from styling the elements on the page with flexboxes, as well as the grid for the "Projects" section. I am still wrapping my head around how elements interact with eachother when using "display: flex". The pictures for the grid was also a challenge for a while as I tried to work around how to get the background image to display correctly. Finally, adapting the webpage to be mobile-friendly was a challenge. In the future, I will try to have a "mobile first" mindset when it comes to building the webpages.

## Future Changes:
I think I would like to try to fit my portrait in somewhere else, possibly inbedded within the text of the about me section. I also would like to make the nav bar have hover effects, as well as making the links in the "Contact Me" section more styled. Obviously, when we get further into the modules, I will update my projects section with up to date completed work.
